Description: Given a few examples of experiments over a time (or spatial) course
    NITPicker selectes a subset of points to sample in follow-up experiments, 
    which would (i) best distinguish between the experimental conditions and the
    control condition (ii) best distinguish between two models of how the 
    experimental condition might differ from the control (iii) a combination of
    the two.
